    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I have actually never tried these. I used to be the best muffin maker I knew back in the day. I worked at Treats,
        which was a coffee shop that specialized in baked muffins as well. That said, these Irish Soda muffins were not
        made there. Perhaps I will have to try them out, since I included them in my recipe project page. We shall see.

    <p>This recipe will take a total of 30 minutes to complete. 10 mins prep time, and 20 mins cooking time. This will
        yield 12 muffins.</p>
